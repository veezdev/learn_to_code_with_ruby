# The print method in Ruby is used to print output to the console.
# Unlike puts, it does not add a new line after each argument passed to it.
# It will also return nil.

print "Hello, World! "
print 3 + 5

# Parentheses are optional in ruby
# and we can combine with single quotes in double quotes like below example
print("Ruby is fun! ", "Let's learn Ruby together. ")
